## What about the physical model?

I have a modified set of files for parts of the prop's body that replace JesseTheMullet's originals, as well as adding some supporting parts.

## Other Files Needed

Another is the overheat sound, and the final is the reload sound, which is comprised of two in game sound effects combined in a serial manner
