# Fallout 4 Last Minute Gauss Rifle

## There be CircuitPython Code Ahead

Built on CPy V3, you'll need a bunch of the CPy libraries provided by Adafruit, and the CPy version of teh Exixe Library

## What about the physical model?

I'm still working on a 3D printable model, but it's based on Kamui Cosplay's Last Minute blueprints, and so I would suggest that you buy that
